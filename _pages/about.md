## About Me

I am an Assistant Professor of Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering at San Diego State University. My group develops AI-enabled smart sensing platforms, computer vision pipelines, and physics-informed digital twins that turn infrastructure data into actionable intelligence for safer, more resilient communities. I enjoy working at the boundary of structural engineering, machine learning, and embedded systems to close the gap between advanced analytics and field deployment.

### Research Focus

- **Autonomous structural health monitoring** for bridges and critical infrastructure
- **Smart sensing and edge computing** with wireless hardware, LoRa communication, and embedded AI
- **Computer vision and generative AI** for drone- and camera-based inspections
- **Scientific machine learning and PINNs** that fuse physics, field data, and simulation
- **Digital twins for resilience** that support rapid decision-making after natural hazards

### Current Appointments

- Assistant Professor, Department of Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering, San Diego State University (2025–present)
- Hardware Research Intern, StructureIQ, Inc., Champaign, IL (Summer 2025)

Previously, I led research at the Smart Structures Technology Laboratory at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, focusing on autonomous infrastructure assessment, synchronized wireless sensing, and bridge monitoring with drones and edge devices.

### Selected Honors

- First Runner-up, 7th Midwest Smart Structures Colloquium (2025)
- Graduate College Conference Presentation Award, UIUC (2024)
- Mavis Future Faculty Fellow, UIUC (2022–2023)
- International Liu Huixian Earthquake Engineering Scholarship (2022)
- Institute Silver Medal, IIT Bombay (2018)

### Recent Highlights

- Full-scale seismic testing campaign for LifeArk modular housing (2025–2026)
- Seminar series on bridging smart sensing and physics-informed AI across San Diego State University (Fall 2025)
- Feature article in STRUCTURE Magazine on AI for indeterminate structural analysis (in press)
