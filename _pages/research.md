## Research Areas

### Autonomous Structural Health Monitoring

We develop autonomous sensing systems that continuously monitor bridges and critical infrastructure, enabling early detection of damage and deterioration. Our approaches combine wireless smart sensors, edge computing, and machine learning to provide real-time condition assessment.

### Smart Sensing and Edge Computing

Our lab designs wireless sensor networks with LoRa communication, embedded AI, and edge processing capabilities. These systems enable distributed intelligence for infrastructure monitoring while minimizing power consumption and data transmission costs.

### Computer Vision and Generative AI

We leverage drone-based imaging and computer vision pipelines for automated infrastructure inspections. Our work includes crack detection, damage quantification, and the use of generative AI for synthetic data augmentation to improve model robustness.

### Physics-Informed Neural Networks

We develop scientific machine learning approaches that fuse physics-based models with data-driven methods. Our physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) enable accurate predictions even with sparse sensor data, improving digital twin capabilities for structural systems.

### Digital Twins for Resilience

Our digital twin platforms integrate real-time sensor data, physics-based models, and AI to support rapid decision-making after natural hazards. These systems help assess structural integrity and guide post-disaster response strategies.
