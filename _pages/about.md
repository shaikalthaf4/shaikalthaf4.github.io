Welcome to the PRISM Lab at San Diego State University. We develop AI-enabled smart sensing platforms, computer vision pipelines, and physics-informed digital twins that turn infrastructure data into actionable intelligence for safer, more resilient communities.

## Research Focus

Our work spans the intersection of structural engineering, machine learning, and embedded systems:

- **Autonomous structural health monitoring** for bridges and critical infrastructure
- **Smart sensing and edge computing** with wireless hardware, LoRa communication, and embedded AI
- **Computer vision and generative AI** for drone- and camera-based inspections
- **Scientific machine learning and PINNs** that fuse physics, field data, and simulation
- **Digital twins for resilience** supporting rapid decision-making after natural hazards

## Recent Highlights

- Full-scale seismic testing campaign for LifeArk modular housing (2025â€“2026)
- Seminar series on bridging smart sensing and physics-informed AI at SDSU (Fall 2025)
- Feature article in STRUCTURE Magazine on AI for indeterminate structural analysis (in press)

## Join Our Team

We are actively recruiting motivated students at all levels. See our [Positions](/positions/) page for current opportunities, including fully funded PhD positions for Fall 2026.
