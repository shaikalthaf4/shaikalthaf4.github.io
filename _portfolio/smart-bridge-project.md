## UIUC Smart Bridge - Living Laboratory

Development of digital-twin based monitoring system for UIUC's newly inaugurated Bahl Smart Bridge. This project involves:

- Real-time pose-estimation for live pedestrian-traffic monitoring
- Localization using computer-vision techniques
- Digital twin implementation for comprehensive monitoring

The system provides continuous monitoring capabilities and demonstrates the integration of computer vision with structural engineering for smart infrastructure applications.

**Technologies Used:**
- Computer Vision
- Digital Twin Technology
- Real-time Processing
- IoT Sensors
