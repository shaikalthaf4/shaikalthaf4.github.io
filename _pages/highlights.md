## UIUC Smart Bridge - Living Laboratory

The University of Illinois Smart Bridge [serves as a living laboratory](https://cee.illinois.edu/news/bahl-smart-bridge-showcased-living-laboratory-education-research) for developing and validating autonomous structural health monitoring technologies. Our work includes deployment of an edge AI system that provides live-traffic information of pedestrains crossing the bridge with real-time rendering for visualization.
