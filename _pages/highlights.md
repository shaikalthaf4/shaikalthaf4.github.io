## UIUC Smart Bridge - Living Laboratory

The University of Illinois Smart Bridge serves as a living laboratory for developing and validating autonomous structural health monitoring technologies. Our work includes deployment of synchronized wireless sensors, edge AI processing, and real-time damage detection algorithms.

*Video/GIF demonstration coming soon*

**Key Technologies:**
- Synchronized high-sensitivity wireless accelerometers
- Edge computing with Raspberry Pi and NVIDIA Jetson
- Real-time modal analysis and damage detection
- LoRa communication for long-range data transmission
